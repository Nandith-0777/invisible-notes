Works with **Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, QuickTime, OBS** and native screen recording on **macOS** and **Windows**.

**One repository, separate installers.** Windows, macOS, Ubuntu and Omarchy share
the app code on this repository’s default `develop` branch. Platform differences
live in `platform.js`, `integrations/` and `packaging/`.

[All platform downloads](https://github.com/Nandith-0777/invisible-notes/releases)
are built together into one draft release for review. See [Ubuntu installation
and tested limits](UBUNTU.md), [the installer](packaging/ubuntu/README.md), and
[how releases work](RELEASE.md). End users install the file for their system;
they do not select an operating-system branch or run npm.

**Linux support in this fork:** see [LINUX.md](LINUX.md) for installation,
Hyprland integration, keychain setup, packaging and verified limits. Ordinary
notes work through X11/XWayland; capture masking is compositor-specific and
**does not protect against direct GPU/KMS recording**.

Demoing a take-home assignment? Giving a code walkthrough while sharing your screen? Keep your talking points on-screen while using a supported capture-exclusion integration. Verify the captured view before sharing sensitive notes.

**Private. Local. Lightweight.** No account, no cloud, no telemetry on note content. Your notes never leave your computer.

## Developers

- **Main developer — [Navya Bijoy](https://github.com/navyabijoy):** creator of Ghost Notes / Invisible Notes and the original application.
- **Co-developer — [Nandith (Nandith-0777)](https://github.com/Nandith-0777):** Linux/Hyprland and Ubuntu GNOME capture support, interface and shortcut improvements, Omarchy integration, and Linux packaging in this fork.

The original project and its Apache-2.0 license are retained. This fork builds on Navya's work.

## Current Linux version — 5 November 2026

This source update is based on app version **1.2.2**. It includes the changes below; previously built Linux packages do not automatically include them. No new binary release is published by this source update.

### Linux desktop and capture integration

- Added Linux AppImage, Debian, and tar.gz build targets, a user-local launcher and desktop entry, and Linux CI coverage.
- Use X11/XWayland by default for note positioning, resize, focus, and collapsed bubbles; retain an explicit native Wayland override.
- Added Hyprland Lua window rules and an optional native companion for **Hyprland 0.56.2**, guarded by the exact compositor build hash. Supported capture paths omit protected notes and show the content behind them. The companion also handles fullscreen pinning and click-through input.
- Added desktop-pointer recovery for the ghost toolbar and resize corner. Improved pointer scaling and mixed pointer-device handling on XWayland.
- Added desktop keychain selection and storage status. Unreadable encrypted stores are preserved, JSON writes use owner-only permissions, and encryption failures are reported.
- Capture exclusion remains desktop- and recorder-specific. **Direct GPU/KMS and direct X11 capture can show notes. GNOME, KDE, other compositors, and other Hyprland builds are not covered by this companion.** Controlled capture and portal tests passed; fresh end-to-end Google Meet and Zoom validation is still required for this package.

### Notes and interface

- Redesigned Notes Manager with a workspace sidebar, note cards, search, counts, and All notes / On desktop / Hidden filters; refined light and dark themes and settings.
- Separated the floating note toolbar from the writing area, with pastel note colors and a distinct purple ghost icon. Ghost mode has a clear active state.
- Reorganized **Aa** formatting and appearance controls into compact popovers, with readable groups and no horizontal scrolling at the default note size.
- Centered note and workspace deletion confirmations inside Notes Manager. Deleting a workspace preserves its notes by moving them into another workspace.
- Smoothed dragging and resizing by coalescing pointer updates, resizing without resetting the window position, and disabling competing Hyprland note animations. Native ghost-mode routing owns the input region without competing Electron shape changes or redundant pointer polling; pin updates are asynchronous and capture status is checked at initialization/reload.
- Improved popover positioning, keyboard menu navigation, focus restoration, and access to hidden notes through the manager.
- Empty notes now say **“A thought, a plan, a little reminder…”**.
- Added an optional [Voxtype dictation helper](LINUX.md#voice-typing-with-voxtype-on-hyprland) for XWayland notes when simulated typing produces digits. It uses native paste only in focused notes and preserves ordinary dictation elsewhere.

### Shortcuts

- Added global actions for New note, Notes Manager, Hide/show all, and Click-through, available while Ghost Notes runs in the tray, even when another app has focus.
- Added a shortcut editor with manual entry, key recording, review before saving, and reset. Every custom shortcut requires **Ctrl, Alt, Shift, or Super plus another key**; plain letters are rejected.
- Support function keys, arrows, navigation keys, punctuation, and numpad keys. Pause Ghost Notes shortcuts while recording, detect duplicates, and preserve the previous binding when a desktop conflict prevents registration.
- Hyprland bindings recover after configuration reloads and remain scoped to the launching installation/profile. Fully quitting Ghost Notes disables its global shortcuts.

### Omarchy plugin and validation

- Prepared a separate [Ghost Notes for Omarchy plugin](https://github.com/Nandith-0777/omarchy-ghost-notes), including the full application source and a bar button: left-click opens Notes Manager; right-click creates a note.
- Documented explicit installation of a locked Electron runtime, optional capture companion setup, updates, and removal. Loading the bar widget performs no dependency installation or desktop configuration changes.
- Added regression tests and disposable-profile validation scripts for capture, pointer input, formatting, manager interactions, resizing, and global/custom shortcuts. See [Linux documentation](LINUX.md), [portability boundaries](LINUX-PORTABILITY.md), and [validation results](validation/linux-parity-20261105/README.md).
- The plugin repository is public; marketplace submission is awaiting owner review and approval.

## Features

- **Screen-capture exclusion** — notes are visible to you, invisible to recordings and screen shares.
- **Always on top** — pinned notes stay above your other apps, including fullscreen apps on macOS.
- **Rich text notes** — bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, headings, quotes, bulleted/numbered lists, **checklists**, text colors, monospace/code mode, adjustable font size and opacity.
- **Paste images** — screenshots and images from the clipboard are embedded straight into a note.
- **Notes Manager** — every note you've ever created in one searchable list: open, hide, rename, move, delete.
- **Workspaces** — group notes (e.g. "Interview", "Personal") and switch between them from the tray or the manager sidebar.
- **Customizable shortcuts** — every shortcut can be rebound in-app, or reset to defaults.
- **Click-through mode** — let clicks pass straight through a note while you keep reading it.
- **Collapse to bubble** — shrink any note into a small floating dot with one click; drag the dot to reposition it, click it to restore the full note. Content stays intact and invisible while collapsed.
- **Multi-monitor aware** — each note remembers its display; off-screen notes are recovered automatically.
- **Local & offline** — one JSON file in your OS app-data folder, optionally encrypted with the OS keychain.

## Install on Omarchy automatically

For the supported Omarchy 4.5.0 and exact Hyprland 0.56.2 build, use the
[automatic Omarchy installer](https://github.com/Nandith-0777/omarchy-ghost-notes#install--one-command):

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Nandith-0777/omarchy-ghost-notes --yes && bash "$HOME/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.nandith-0777.ghost-notes/scripts/install.sh"
```

It checks compatibility, installs missing dependencies, builds and enables the
native capture companion, adds launchers and login startup, and opens the app.
Affected configuration is backed up and configuration failures roll back.
Capture protection still depends on the actual recorder's capture path.

## Install

<img src="build/icon.png" alt="Ghost Notes app icon" width="72" height="72" align="right" />

Grab the latest build from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Nandith-0777/invisible-notes/releases)**:

| Platform     | Artifact                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS        | `Ghost-Notes-*-universal.dmg` (Intel + Apple Silicon)               |
| Windows      | `Ghost-Notes-Setup-*.exe` (NSIS installer)                          |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | `Ghost-Notes-*-ubuntu-24.04-amd64.deb` (complete preview installer) |

> [!NOTE]
> Builds are currently **unsigned**. On macOS you may need to right-click → **Open** the first time (or `xattr -cr /Applications/Ghost\ Notes.app`); on Windows choose **More info → Run anyway** in SmartScreen. This is expected until code-signing is configured — see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

Ubuntu users install the `.deb` with App Center and restart Ubuntu once. See
[the supported compositor version and install steps](UBUNTU.md).

Prefer to run from source with Node.js 22 or newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nandith-0777/invisible-notes.git
cd invisible-notes
npm install
npm start
```

The app lives in the **menu bar / system tray** (no Dock icon on macOS) — look for the ghost icon:

<img src="build/tray-icon.png" alt="Ghost Notes tray icon" width="20" height="20" />

A note appears near your cursor on first launch.

## How it works

Each note is a frameless, transparent Electron `BrowserWindow` with `setContentProtection(true)`. The operating system excludes that window from screen capture while you still see it normally. Notes are always-on-top (`screen-saver` level) and, on macOS, visible on every Space including fullscreen apps.

Content protection is applied before a note is first shown and re-applied after every hide/restore on Windows. If a saved position falls outside every connected display, the note is clamped back onto a visible screen before it appears.

## Usage

### Note controls

Use the toolbar at the top of each note:

| Control             | What it does                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⠿ (drag handle)     | Drag to move the note. Drag the bottom-right resize handle to resize.                                                                                    |
| Color dot           | Opens the palette — pick the note's color.                                                                                                               |
| Appearance controls | Change the note color, opacity, and text size.                                                                                                           |
| **Aa** (Formatting) | Bold / italic / underline / strikethrough, headings, quote, bullet/numbered/check lists, text colors, `{}` monospace.                                    |
| `A−` / `A+`         | Smaller / larger text.                                                                                                                                   |
| 📌 Pin              | **Pinned (default):** always on top, even when you switch apps. **Unpinned:** behaves like a normal window.                                              |
| 👻 Ghost            | Click-through mode — clicks pass to whatever is behind the note. Hover the bar to interact again.                                                        |
| ＋                  | Creates a new note.                                                                                                                                      |
| −                   | **Collapse** — shrinks the note into a small floating bubble. The bubble stays screen-capture-excluded and draggable. Click it to restore the full note. |
| ✕                   | **Hides** the note — it does _not_ delete it. It stays in the Notes Manager and can be reopened any time.                                                |

Permanently deleting a note is only possible from the **Notes Manager** (with a confirmation prompt).

### Keyboard shortcuts

Linux uses the Windows combinations below (Super is also available for custom shortcuts).

| Action                      | macOS  | Windows            | Scope      |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| New note                    | `⌘⇧N`  | `Ctrl+Shift+N`     | App        |
| New note from anywhere      | `⌘⌥⇧N` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N` | **Global** |
| Notes Manager               | `⌘⇧M`  | `Ctrl+Shift+M`     | App        |
| Hide / show all notes       | `⌘⇧H`  | `Ctrl+Shift+H`     | App        |
| Toggle click-through (all)  | `⌘⇧G`  | `Ctrl+Shift+G`     | App        |
| Notes Manager from anywhere | `⌘⌥⇧M` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M` | **Global** |
| Hide / show from anywhere   | `⌘⌥⇧H` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H` | **Global** |
| Click-through from anywhere | `⌘⌥⇧G` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G` | **Global** |
| Search notes (in Manager)   | `⌘K`   | `Ctrl+K`           | Manager    |
| Close dialog / cancel       | `Esc`  | `Esc`              | Manager    |

**Scope** matters: app-scoped shortcuts only fire while a Ghost Notes window has focus, so the same keys stay free for your browser, IDE and OS. The **global** shortcuts work while another application has focus, including when every note is hidden. Ghost Notes must stay running in the tray. Settings → Shortcuts shows a warning if a global combination is already in use.

For combinations that work while using your browser or editor, edit the **Global shortcuts — use from any app** section at the top of **Settings → Shortcuts**. The **App-only** section provides separate optional shortcuts that require a focused Ghost Notes window.

Customize these under **Settings → Shortcuts**: click the pencil, type a combination or click **Record keys**, then **Save shortcut**. Every shortcut requires at least one modifier (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, or Super) plus another key. The editor preserves the modifiers you choose and supports letters, numbers, F1–F24, navigation keys, punctuation, and numpad keys. Duplicate and desktop-reserved combinations are rejected without replacing your previous shortcut. **Reset** restores the default.

You never have to come back here to look any of this up: **tray icon → Keyboard Shortcuts…**, or the **?** button in the Notes Manager, shows the live list, lets you rebind any row, and reset to defaults.

### Notes Manager

Open it with `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M`, the tray menu, or the **?** button.

- **Search** all notes instantly (`Cmd/Ctrl+K` to focus).
- **Open / hide** a note, **rename** it inline, **move** it to another workspace, or **delete** it permanently.
- **Workspaces** sidebar with per-workspace note counts.
- Toolbar buttons for **New note**, **Export** and **Import**.
- **Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar): Appearance, Shortcuts, Storage, About.

### Workspaces

Workspaces let you keep separate piles of notes (client work, interviews, shopping lists…).

- Create, rename and delete them from the manager sidebar (the last remaining workspace can't be deleted).
- Move a note between workspaces via its **⋯** menu in the list.
- Switch the active workspace from the tray menu (**Switch Workspace**) or the workspace chip in the manager.
- Notes always belong to a workspace; deleting a workspace moves its notes to another one instead of losing them.

### Backup & restore

In the Notes Manager toolbar (or **Settings → Storage**):

- **Export all notes** writes every note to a plain JSON backup file. The file itself is **not** encrypted — keep it somewhere safe.
- **Import notes** restores a backup, either **merging** it with your current notes (duplicates skipped) or **replacing** them.

### Settings

**Settings → Appearance** changes the manager's own look — light/dark/system theme and accent color. It only affects the manager window; every note keeps its own color.

## Verify the invisibility

1. Start a screen recording (QuickTime → File → New Screen Recording on macOS, `Win+Shift+R` on Windows 11, or OBS), **or** join a Zoom/Meet/Teams call and share your screen.
2. The note stays visible on your screen but does **not** appear in the recording or for viewers.

> First time only on macOS: the OS may ask you to grant the app **Screen Recording** permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Content protection works regardless, but granting it avoids the OS prompt.

## Storage & privacy

- **No login, no account, no cloud sync, no analytics.** The app works fully offline after install.
- All note data (text, position, size, color, opacity, formatting, open/hidden state, settings, shortcut overrides) is stored in **one JSON file**: `notes.json` inside the Electron `userData` folder — `%APPDATA%\invisible-notes\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/invisible-notes/` on macOS.
- **Encrypted at rest** with the OS keychain (`safeStorage`: DPAPI on Windows, Keychain on macOS) whenever the platform supports it. If it doesn't, notes are stored in plaintext and a warning is logged. Exports are always plain JSON.
- Pasted images live as files under `userData/note-images/`; the JSON only references their filenames.
- If `notes.json` is ever corrupted, it's backed up and reset rather than deleted — you're told where the backup is.

## Multi-monitor

Each note remembers which display it was on. If a monitor is disconnected, or a note's saved position ends up off-screen (resolution/DPI change, etc.), it's automatically repositioned back onto a connected display the next time you see it — notes never become permanently unreachable.

## Platform support & known limitations

Ghost Notes is built to work on both macOS and Windows, but a couple of OS-level behaviors are genuinely not identical — documented here rather than silently assumed:

| Behavior                                                | macOS                                                             | Windows                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Screen-capture exclusion                                | Reliable across QuickTime, native recording, Zoom/Meet/Teams, OBS | Requires Windows 10 build 19041 (May 2020 Update) or later. On older Windows builds, notes may be visible to screen recordings — this is an OS limitation, not a bug. |
| Visible over fullscreen apps you're sharing             | Yes (`visibleOnFullScreenSpaces`)                                 | No native equivalent — Windows has no per-app virtual-desktop concept like macOS Spaces. Always-on-top still applies otherwise.                                       |
| Tray icon                                               | Adaptive light/dark menu bar icon                                 | Standard system tray icon                                                                                                                                             |

If you hit different behavior on Windows than described here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/navyabijoy/invisible-notes/issues) with your Windows build number.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>I can't find the app / no window opens</b></summary>

Ghost Notes is tray-only. Look for the ghost icon in the menu bar (macOS) or the system tray overflow (`^` arrow, Windows). Click it → **New Note**, or press the global shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A shortcut does nothing</b></summary>

App-scoped shortcuts only work while a Ghost Notes window is focused — that's intentional so they don't shadow your other apps. If the _global_ shortcut is silent, another app already owns that keybinding; rebind it under **Keyboard Shortcuts…**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows SmartScreen / macOS Gatekeeper blocks the app</b></summary>

Builds are unsigned (see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)). Windows: **More info → Run anyway**. macOS: right-click → **Open**, or `xattr -cr /Applications/Ghost\ Notes.app`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Notes appear in the recording (Windows)</b></summary>

Screen-capture exclusion needs Windows 10 build 19041 or newer. Check with `winver`. On older builds this is an OS limitation, not a bug.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A note vanished</b></summary>

Notes are hidden, not deleted (unless you deleted them in the Manager). Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H` to show all, or open the **Notes Manager** — everything you've ever created is listed there.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I only see a small dot — where did my note go?</b></summary>

The note is collapsed into a floating bubble. Click the dot once to restore it to full size. You can also drag the bubble to reposition it before restoring.
</details>

## Development

**Requirements:** Node.js 22.12+ and npm.

```bash
npm install       # install dependencies
npm start         # launch the tray app (Electron)
npm test          # Node's built-in test runner (node --test)
npm run format    # Prettier, write
npm run format:check  # Prettier, verify (CI runs this)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs formatting checks and tests on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS across Node 22 and 24.

**Architecture** (full details in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)):

```text
main.js          app entry — windows, tray, IPC, store, shortcuts
store.js         NoteStore — versioned JSON persistence + optional OS encryption
platform.js      every platform branch lives here (never check process.platform elsewhere)
displayUtils.js  multi-monitor helpers (clamping, display-id lookup)
note/            note window: factory, renderer, preload
manager/         Notes Manager window, shortcuts, renderer, preload
test/            store + shortcut tests (node --test)
docs/            marketing site (GitHub Pages)
```

There is **no bundler and no TypeScript** — plain Node.js + Electron with CommonJS `require`. IPC payloads are validated in the main process before touching the store, and all platform-specific behavior is isolated in `platform.js`.

## Building a standalone app

```bash
npm run dist:mac    # macOS .dmg / .zip (universal)
npm run dist:win    # Windows installer (.exe via NSIS)
npm run dist:ubuntu # Ubuntu 24.04 .deb with the native capture integration
npm run dist:linux  # Generic Linux AppImage / .tar.gz; no Ubuntu capture companion
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), which builds macOS, Windows and Linux artifacts and attaches them to a GitHub Release. See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for signing/notarization setup and the full release checklist.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first. In short:

1. Comment on the issue you want before writing code; wait to be assigned.
2. Branch from `develop` as `feat/issue-N-…` or `fix/issue-N-…`.
3. Open a PR **against `develop`**, reference the issue (`Closes #N`).
4. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (`feat(note): …`, `fix(platform): …`).
5. `npm run format:check` and `node --test` must pass.

### Show a note in screen sharing

Each note has a monitor-and-arrow button beside the ghost button. Click it to
show that note in screen sharing; orange means sharing is enabled. Click again
to request capture protection. This preference survives reopening and restarting.
Existing and new notes default to private. The ghost button still controls only
mouse click-through.

Sharing applies to a captured screen containing the note; sharing an unrelated
application window or browser tab does not include it. Capture protection depends
on the platform and capture method. In particular, macOS ScreenCaptureKit can
bypass Electron content protection; turning protection on is not a guarantee
that viewers cannot see the note. On Hyprland, install the bundled capture
integration and updated window rules.

### Experimental Ubuntu GNOME capture integration

The Ubuntu development branch includes a Mutter 46.2 capture prototype for
Ubuntu 24.04 / GNOME 46 on Wayland. Real PipeWire monitor and region tests verify
that private notes stay visible locally while capture shows the live content
behind them. The per-note sharing button includes a note in capture when enabled.

This currently requires a VM-tested compositor build and a desktop-session
restart. The complete `.deb` has passed installation/removal testing in the Ubuntu VM,
and Google Meet invisibility was manually verified. Zoom and additional hardware
remain pending. See [the integration guide](integrations/gnome-capture/README.md)
and its rollback instructions. The Omarchy installer remains Hyprland-specific.
